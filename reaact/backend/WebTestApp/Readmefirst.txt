Although this is a small app for the backend. I just wanted to let you know that I know about clean architecture and how to use it for
microservices. I just left blank some of the projects and folders, but it should grows according to app. I just put the minimum.
Also, you can handle request using CQRS, using  Mediatr o Message bus patterns. I just left the packages, not the implementation.
